    <p>In a previous post we discussed the problem of stocking our food cart to maximize our profitability. We created a simple heuristic and then performed simulations to evaluate the expected profitability. We discussed that knowing the expected profitability was not enough, we calculated Confidence Intervals to understand the where the true expected profitability lies. This week we want to find a better plan for packing the food cart. We will use Mathematical Planning to find an answer which maximize the expected profitability which outperforms the heuristic used in the first post....</p>

The fields are close to one another and solutions often involve both techniques. The way I differentiate is based on what question they are meant to answer. Mathematical Planning is primarily concerned with answering the question, “What should we do?” Machine Learning answers the question, “What is most likely?...</p>

      The Under Appreciated Power of Object Expressions

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>There is a feature of F# this is incredibly powerful and rarely talked about: The Object Expression. It is such a simple idea that it is almost boring but the implications of it are profound. We often define an interface to abstract the implementation of an object so that we can code against different implementations. By programming against an IEnumerable or IDictionary, we can write algorithms which work against a host of different backing data structures....</p>

    <p>Recently I was asked if it would be possible to add the log function to the Flips library. Flips is a library for modeling and solving Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming problems. Both classes of problems are constrained to only having linear (i.e. straight) lines. You may ask, “What do you mean by straight?” The following are examples of linear functions.
$$ \displaylines{ \text{Linear Functions}\\
y=1.0x&#43;2.0 \\
y=2.0x_{1}&#43;3.0x_{2} \\
