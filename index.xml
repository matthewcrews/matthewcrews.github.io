      <description>Welcome to part 2 of this series. In the previous post we setup our problem which is to speed up the SliceMap family of types for sparse data. We created benchmarks and measured the performance of the current implementation. I gave a brief overview of a new approach I had come up with and showed how it failed miserably.
We were in a depressing place at the end of the last post but hope burns eternal!</description>

      <description>I have been on a journey to overhaul the underpinnings of the Flips library and it has been a humbling experience. Part of what I believe provides a unique value add compared to other libraries for Mathematical Planning is the SliceMap types. They provide a convenient method for subsetting your data that is intuitive for someone who writes optimization models. The SliceMap types are heavily influenced by the TupleDict type in the Gurobi library for Python.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked about what resources I would recommend for Linear Programming. My response was, &amp;ldquo;Are you interested in problem formulation? Solution techniques? Algorithmic implementation?&amp;rdquo; The answer was, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; Here are the resources that I would recommend for those wanting to dive deep into Linear Programming (LP). Note, I will be focusing strictly on LP instead of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). MIP is a logical evolution of LP but brings in a whole host of other challenges.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to consult with my friend on the job assignments problem that I have been discussing in post 1 and post 2. At first, he was excited about what we had come up with but I knew there were likely more complexities that had not been uncovered yet. He went back to the client and came away with some new information. He told me, &amp;ldquo;Mathew, it turns out that machines have limited capacity.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I introduced a scheduling problem where I needed to assign jobs to machines to achieve the maximum efficiency. We say efficiency is calculated as the number of times a machine must change the job-type it is working on. I want to continue exploring this problem by adding some nuance.
 Note: Full code for this post can be found here
 Not Too Many Bad Jobs As my conversation continued with my friend regarding this problem a new constraint came up.</description>

      <description>I was recently having a discussion with a friend when they brought up a new problem they were looking into. He asked me if it was a good candidate for Mathematical Planning and I said, &amp;ldquo;Absolutely!&amp;rdquo; I am abstracting away the specific domain, but this is the essence of the problem.
There are a set of machines which can process jobs. The jobs are of different types and sizes.</description>

      <description>I was recently posed the question, &amp;ldquo;Can you use Mathematical Planning to optimize the Cutting Stock problem?&amp;rdquo; For those who are not familiar with this problem, you can find the Wikipedia article here. In summary, you have a stock size of paper material from which you need to produce smaller sizes. In the example provided on Wikipedia, the stock size is 5600mm. You are asked to produce a variety of sizes between 1380mm and 2200mm.</description>

      <description>In the previous two posts in this series we introduced the Food Cart Problem. We want a plan for stocking our Food Cart which will maximizes our revenue. In the first post we discussed the foods that we can stock and the restrictions we are operating under. We introduced a simple heuristic for stocking the food cart and created a simulation in order to validate what our expected revenue is.</description>

      <description>In a previous post we discussed the problem of stocking our food cart to maximize our profitability. We created a simple heuristic and then performed simulations to evaluate the expected profitability. We discussed that knowing the expected profitability was not enough, we calculated Confidence Intervals to understand the where the true expected profitability lies. This week we want to find a better plan for packing the food cart. We will use Mathematical Planning to find an answer which maximize the expected profitability which outperforms the heuristic used in the first post.</description>

      <description>One of the questions that I love to answer is, &amp;ldquo;What is the difference between Mathematical Planning and Machine Learning?&amp;rdquo; This is an excellent question. The fields are close to one another and solutions often involve both techniques. The way I differentiate is based on what question they are meant to answer. Mathematical Planning is primarily concerned with answering the question, &amp;ldquo;What should we do?&amp;rdquo; Machine Learning answers the question, &amp;ldquo;What is most likely?</description>

 Antoine de Saint-Exupery   On my journey of growing as a developer, I am consistently inspired by language features which seem incredibly simple but yield remarkable benefit. As I try to master F#, I am frequently surprised by how powerful the language is for expressing ideas while having so few features.</description>

 I was having a chat with a friend about what types of problems are good candidates for Mathematical Planning.

      <description>There is a feature of F# this is incredibly powerful and rarely talked about: The Object Expression. It is such a simple idea that it is almost boring but the implications of it are profound. We often define an interface to abstract the implementation of an object so that we can code against different implementations. By programming against an IEnumerable or IDictionary, we can write algorithms which work against a host of different backing data structures.</description>

      <description>There are few things I love more than a fresh mathematical planning challenge so I was delighted when Kevin Avignon reached out to me and asked me to look at a question he had posted on the Software Engineer Stack Exchange site. He wanted to know whether the question was a candidate for Mathematical Planning. The question is a really interesting problem of pairing Mentors and Mentees. Mentors have a set of skills they can teach.</description>

      <description>Recently I was asked if it would be possible to add the log function to the Flips library. Flips is a library for modeling and solving Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming problems. Both classes of problems are constrained to only having linear (i.e. straight) lines. You may ask, &amp;ldquo;What do you mean by straight?&amp;rdquo; The following are examples of linear functions.
$$ \displaylines{ \text{Linear Functions}\\
y=1.0x+2.0 \\
y=2.0x_{1}+3.0x_{2} \\
y=1.2x_{1}+1.7x_{2}+x_{3} } $$</description>

      <description>I am on a bit of a quest to bring Mathematical Optimization to the masses, or at least to Software Developers. I often come across problems where people are wanting to find the best plan for their problem but they lack to tools to express the problem. Typically the way this is &amp;ldquo;solved&amp;rdquo; is by some domain expert coming up with a laborious heuristic in Excel which involves outrageous amount of copying and pasting.</description>

      <description>Previously I described how we can perform Discrete Optimization using the Branch and Bound technique. Today I want to describe another foundational technique for Discrete Optimization, Cutting Planes. Cutting Planes is like the Branch and Bound technique in that it uses a series of LP Relaxations to search for solutions. Where it is different from Branch and Bound is in how it refines the LP Formulations. Branch and Bound would subdivide the solution space by branching on a decision variable and creating two new subproblems.</description>

      <description>If you have spent any time with me you will know that I am passionate about Optimization. Now, you may pass this off as a bit of geekiness on my part but the reason I care about Optimization is that it has profound implications for how we care for people. When I get a moment to describe Optimization to someone the way I start off is by saying, &amp;ldquo;Optimization is the mathematics of caring for people.</description>

      <description>One of the reasons that I love F# is that is makes it incredibly easy to model domains. By creating a Domain Model which represents the business domain it becomes relatively easy to create workflows and algorithms which streamline business processes. In this post I show how to create types for a domain which are summable, a feature I use frequently in my work.
The Value of Restricting Values When I have to create a new Domain Model one of the first things that I do is define a single case Discriminated Union of decimal for the basic building blocks that I am going to work with (Costs, Items, Sales Rates, Days of Inventory, etc.</description>

Using a mathematical solver requires the ability to formulate models and at this time one of the easiest languages for doing that is Python. Python is a great language for many use cases.</description>

      <description>One of the things that most attracted me to F# is the ability to accurately model your domain. What first turned me on to this was a talk by Scott Wlaschin on Functional programming design patterns. Scott has a more focused talk on Domain Modeling Made Functional that he did a few years later and a book with the same title. This whole concept was blowing my mind. The idea of modeling your domain such that illegal states are unrepresentable sounds immensely satisfying to me.</description>

      <description>The title for this may be a little over the top but it is not far from the truth. I am wanting to show how Units of Measure in F# can protect against some of the most insidious types of errors, mismatched units.
One of the most difficult parts of putting together algorithms has been making sure that the Units of Measure for numbers match. For example, you should not be able to add lbs and cm, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.</description>

Normally I would just write a query for the database to get all of this information but in this case I do not have access to the database directly.

      <description>The best answer to the right question. I partner with teams to identify the decision processes that are driving their success then collaborate to build tools based on Machine Learning and Mathematical Planning to ensure the best possible answer, every time.
I also produce articles and training material to equip software developers to build their own Mathematical Planning models to provide outstanding solutions for their clients. Few things bring me more joy than seeing others harness the tools of Mathematical Planning to help others.</description>
