      SliceMap Rework - Part 2

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Welcome to part 2 of this series. In the previous post we setup our problem which is to speed up the SliceMap family of types for sparse data. We created benchmarks and measured the performance of the current implementation. I gave a brief overview of a new approach I had come up with and showed how it failed miserably.
We were in a depressing place at the end of the last post but hope burns eternal!...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I have been on a journey to overhaul the underpinnings of the Flips library and it has been a humbling experience. Part of what I believe provides a unique value add compared to other libraries for Mathematical Planning is the SliceMap types. They provide a convenient method for subsetting your data that is intuitive for someone who writes optimization models. The SliceMap types are heavily influenced by the TupleDict type in the Gurobi library for Python....</p>

      Resources for Linear Programming

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I was recently asked about what resources I would recommend for Linear Programming. My response was, “Are you interested in problem formulation? Solution techniques? Algorithmic implementation?” The answer was, “Yes!” Here are the resources that I would recommend for those wanting to dive deep into Linear Programming (LP). Note, I will be focusing strictly on LP instead of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). MIP is a logical evolution of LP but brings in a whole host of other challenges....</p>

    <p>I’ve continued to consult with my friend on the job assignments problem that I have been discussing in post 1 and post 2. At first, he was excited about what we had come up with but I knew there were likely more complexities that had not been uncovered yet. He went back to the client and came away with some new information. He told me, “Mathew, it turns out that machines have limited capacity....</p>

    <p>In my previous post I introduced a scheduling problem where I needed to assign jobs to machines to achieve the maximum efficiency. We say efficiency is calculated as the number of times a machine must change the job-type it is working on. I want to continue exploring this problem by adding some nuance.

There are a set of machines which can process jobs. The jobs are of different types and sizes....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I was recently posed the question, “Can you use Mathematical Planning to optimize the Cutting Stock problem?” For those who are not familiar with this problem, you can find the Wikipedia article here. In summary, you have a stock size of paper material from which you need to produce smaller sizes. In the example provided on Wikipedia, the stock size is 5600mm. You are asked to produce a variety of sizes between 1380mm and 2200mm....</p>

    <p>In a previous post we discussed the problem of stocking our food cart to maximize our profitability. We created a simple heuristic and then performed simulations to evaluate the expected profitability. We discussed that knowing the expected profitability was not enough, we calculated Confidence Intervals to understand the where the true expected profitability lies. This week we want to find a better plan for packing the food cart. We will use Mathematical Planning to find an answer which maximize the expected profitability which outperforms the heuristic used in the first post....</p>
